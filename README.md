This project analyzes a dataset of Russian and Chinese ballistic missiles using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques implemented in R.

The analysis includes:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Missing value imputation (interpolation + PCA-based regression)
Prediction of maximum range (max_domet_km)
Classification of launcher type
Clustering using DBSCAN
Interpretation in historical and geopolitical context (1988–2018)

The work was completed as part of the course Statistical Software 3 (2025).
